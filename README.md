## AI Response Feature

When the bot is directly mentioned in a message or when a message starts with the bot's name, it will:
1. Show a typing indicator while waiting for the API response
2. Send the content to Google's Gemini API with conversation context
3. Apply a realistic typing delay based on response length (0.2 seconds per word, minimum 2s, maximum 5s)
4. Post the AI-generated response as a reply to the user's message

When directly addressed (via mention or when a message starts with the bot's name), the bot will reply to the message, making it clear which message it's responding to. For other triggers like keyword detection, the bot will respond with a regular message.

### Conversation Context

The bot includes conversation context when making API calls to Gemini. This means:

1. The bot retrieves the last 5 messages from the conversation history
2. These messages are included in the prompt sent to Gemini
3. Gemini can generate more contextually relevant responses based on the conversation flow
4. The bot appears more coherent and can maintain conversation threads

This feature makes the bot feel more natural in conversations and helps it remember what was previously discussed.

### Customizing Prompts and Models

The prompt sent to Gemini can be customized by setting the `GEMINI_PROMPT_WRAPPER` in your `CrowConfig.toml` file. The wrapper should include placeholders:
- `{message}` - The user's message
- `{bot_name}` - The bot's name
- `{user}` - The user's display name
- `{context}` - Recent conversation history (last 5 messages)

You can also configure which Gemini model to use by setting the `GEMINI_API_ENDPOINT` in your `CrowConfig.toml` file. This allows you to switch between different models like `gemini-1.0-pro`, `gemini-1.5-pro`, `gemini-1.5-flash` or `gemini-2.0-flash`.

## Quiet Channels

The bot supports "quiet channels" where it will only respond when directly addressed. This is useful for channels where you want the bot available but don't want it to randomly interject or respond to keywords.

### Configuration

Configure quiet channels in your `CrowConfig.toml` file:

```toml
# Single quiet channel
QUIET_CHANNEL_NAME = "serious-discussion"

# Multiple quiet channels
QUIET_CHANNEL_NAMES = "serious-discussion,work-chat,announcements"
```

### Behavior in Quiet Channels

In quiet channels, the bot will **only** respond to:

1. **Direct mentions** - `@BotName what's the weather?`
2. **Messages starting with the bot's name** - `Crow, tell me a joke`
3. **Commands** - `!help`, `!quote`, etc.

The bot will **not** respond to:
- Random interjections
- Keyword triggers
- Special responses (like "whoa" â†’ "I know kung fu!")
- AI-generated conversation starters

This allows you to have the bot available for explicit requests while keeping channels focused and distraction-free.

## Random Interjections

The bot occasionally makes random interjections in the conversation. There are six types of interjections, each with its own configurable probability:

### Configuration

Each interjection type can be configured separately in the `CrowConfig.toml` file:

```toml
# Random Interjection Probabilities (chance per message)
# Each type has its own probability - set to 0 to disable
INTERJECTION_MST3K_PROBABILITY = "0.005"  # Default: 0.5% chance (1 in 200)
INTERJECTION_MEMORY_PROBABILITY = "0.005"  # Default: 0.5% chance (1 in 200)
INTERJECTION_PONDERING_PROBABILITY = "0.005"  # Default: 0.5% chance (1 in 200)
INTERJECTION_AI_PROBABILITY = "0.005"  # Default: 0.5% chance (1 in 200)
INTERJECTION_FACT_PROBABILITY = "0.005"  # Default: 0.5% chance (1 in 200)
INTERJECTION_NEWS_PROBABILITY = "0.005"  # Default: 0.5% chance (1 in 200)
```

Setting any probability to 0 will disable that type of interjection completely.

### Interjection Types

1. **MST3K Quotes** - Random quotes from Mystery Science Theater 3000, a cult classic TV show. The bot will occasionally interject with one of these quotes, adding humor to the conversation.

2. **Channel Memory** - Quotes something someone previously said in the channel. This creates a sense of continuity and can bring up relevant past discussions.

3. **Message Pondering** - Thoughtful comments about the conversation, such as "That's an interesting point" or "I was just thinking about that." These interjections make the bot feel more engaged in the conversation.

4. **AI Interjection** - AI-generated comments using the Gemini API. The bot analyzes the conversation context and provides a comment that feels like a natural part of the discussion.

5. **Fact Interjection** - AI-generated interesting facts related to the conversation. Unlike the general AI interjection, fact interjections are specifically focused on providing informative content.

6. **News Interjection** - AI-generated links to interesting technology or weird news articles (excluding sports) with commentary on why they're interesting and how they relate to the conversation. The format looks like: "Article title: https://example.com/article-path This shows how [technology/topic] is advancing in interesting ways."

## Display Name Handling

The bot uses a sophisticated approach to determine the best display name for users:

1. **Server Nickname** - First priority, if the user has set a nickname in the server
2. **Global Display Name** - Second priority, if the user has set a global display name
3. **Username** - Last resort, if no other display name is available

This ensures that users are addressed by their preferred name in the server context, improving the personalization of the bot's responses.

## Database Structure

### Message History Database

The bot maintains a comprehensive SQLite database to store user message history with all Discord metadata:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    message_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    channel_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    guild_id TEXT,
    author_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    author TEXT NOT NULL,
    display_name TEXT,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
    referenced_message_id TEXT
);
```

This enhanced schema allows the bot to:
1. Store complete message objects with all Discord metadata
2. Provide rich context for AI responses
3. Support the `!quote -dud` command to retrieve random messages from users
4. Maintain conversation threads and references
5. Track edited messages to maintain accurate conversation context

The bot automatically manages its message history:
1. New messages are stored as they arrive with all metadata
2. Edited messages are updated to maintain accurate conversation context
3. The database is periodically trimmed to keep only the most recent messages (up to `MESSAGE_HISTORY_LIMIT`)
4. The trim interval can be configured with `DB_TRIM_INTERVAL_SECS` (defaults to 3600 seconds / 1 hour)
5. Existing databases are automatically migrated to the enhanced schema

### Quote Database Tables

The quote system uses MySQL and requires three related tables:

1. **masterlist_shows** - Contains information about TV shows
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE masterlist_shows (
       show_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       show_title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

2. **masterlist_episodes** - Contains information about episodes
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE masterlist_episodes (
       show_id INT,
       show_ep VARCHAR(10),
       title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       PRIMARY KEY (show_id, show_ep),
       FOREIGN KEY (show_id) REFERENCES masterlist_shows(show_id)
   );
   ```

3. **masterlist_quotes** - Contains the actual quotes
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE masterlist_quotes (
       quote_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       show_id INT,
       show_ep VARCHAR(10),
       quote TEXT NOT NULL,
       FOREIGN KEY (show_id, show_ep) REFERENCES masterlist_episodes(show_id, show_ep)
   );
   ```

### Slogan Database Table

The slogan system uses a single MySQL table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE nuke_quotes (
    pn_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    pn_quote TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## Configuration Options

The bot can be configured through the `CrowConfig.toml` file:

- `DISCORD_TOKEN` - Your Discord bot token
- `FOLLOWED_CHANNEL_ID` - ID of a single channel to follow
- `FOLLOWED_CHANNEL_NAME` - Name of a single channel to follow
- `FOLLOWED_CHANNEL_IDS` - Comma-separated list of channel IDs to follow
- `FOLLOWED_CHANNEL_NAMES` - Comma-separated list of channel names to follow
- `FOLLOWED_SERVER_NAME` - Name of the server to look for channels in
- `QUIET_CHANNEL_NAME` - Name of a single quiet channel (bot only responds when directly addressed)
- `QUIET_CHANNEL_NAMES` - Comma-separated list of quiet channel names
- `BOT_NAME` - Name of the bot (defaults to "Crow")
- `MESSAGE_HISTORY_LIMIT` - Maximum number of messages to store (defaults to 10000)
- `DB_TRIM_INTERVAL_SECS` - How often to trim the database (defaults to 3600 seconds)
- `GEMINI_RATE_LIMIT_MINUTE` - Maximum Gemini API calls per minute (defaults to 15)
- `GEMINI_RATE_LIMIT_DAY` - Maximum Gemini API calls per day (defaults to 1500)
- `GEMINI_IMAGE_RATE_LIMIT_MINUTE` - Maximum Gemini image generation calls per minute (defaults to 5)
- `GEMINI_IMAGE_RATE_LIMIT_DAY` - Maximum Gemini image generation calls per day (defaults to 100)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your Gemini API key
- `GEMINI_API_ENDPOINT` - Custom Gemini API endpoint
- `GEMINI_PROMPT_WRAPPER` - Custom prompt wrapper for Gemini API calls
- `GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENABLED` - Enable or disable DuckDuckGo search feature (defaults to "true") (Note: Despite the name, this controls DuckDuckGo search)
- `IMAGINE_CHANNELS` - Comma-separated list of channel names where image generation is allowed (if empty, allowed in all channels)
- `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD` - MySQL database credentials

## Image Generation

The bot supports AI-powered image generation using Google's Gemini API. When users run the `!imagine [text]` command, the bot will generate an image based on the provided text prompt.

### Configuration

- Set `IMAGINE_CHANNELS` in your config to restrict image generation to specific channels
- Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` to be configured
- Uses separate rate limiting from text generation via `GEMINI_IMAGE_RATE_LIMIT_MINUTE` and `GEMINI_IMAGE_RATE_LIMIT_DAY`
- Default image generation limits are more conservative: 5 calls per minute, 100 calls per day

### Rate Limiting

Image generation has its own separate rate limiting system:

- **Per-minute limits**: When the per-minute limit is reached, the bot will automatically retry after the rate limit resets
- **Daily limits**: When the daily limit is reached, image generation is disabled for the rest of the day
- Rate limits are configurable via `GEMINI_IMAGE_RATE_LIMIT_MINUTE` and `GEMINI_IMAGE_RATE_LIMIT_DAY`

### Quota Management

The image generation feature includes automatic quota management:

- If the API returns a `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` error with status code 429 indicating quota exhaustion, the bot will automatically disable image generation for the rest of the day
- Users will receive a message: "Image generation quota has been exceeded for today. This feature will be available again tomorrow."
- The quota resets automatically at midnight UTC
- This prevents unnecessary API calls and provides clear feedback to users when the daily quota is reached
